# Kari's Solutions to Rich 4Clojure

I forked [PEZ/[rich4clojure](https://github.com/PEZ/rich4clojure) repo to do the Clojure exercises and save my progress in this forked Github repo.

I add the line  
`;; KARI: DONE *************************************************`  
at the beginning of the file when I have done that particular exercise to keep track of my progress.

This will also be a good test for my new VSCode/Calva setup, read more about it in my blog: [Configuring VSCode/Calva for Clojure programming](https://www.karimarttila.fi/clojure/2022/10/08/clojure-calva.html).

I added `nrepl/nrepl {:mvn/version "1.0.0"}` into the [deps.edn](deps.edn) file to launch the REPL in command line (using `just backend-kari`).
